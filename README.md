# Project 1: Shared shopping list
#SQL #JavaScript #CSS
First project in the course. Would add link heroku link here for trying the shopping list app, but just now i have problems adding this project to heroku, TBC. Otherwise you need an example docker desktop to run this app.

This is app for creating shopping lists and adding items to them. There is option for adding and removing items from invidual shopping lists. Lists are in aplhabetic order.
